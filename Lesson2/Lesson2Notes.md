### 2.4 Brief History of Machine Learning

* 1950s
	*  AI was an emerging where the main focus was to build programs  to copy the way humans think and act.
* 1980s
	* The focus shifted towards specific areas of AI. One area was Machine Learning which is dealing with writing programs to identify patterns without explicitly being programmed to do so. 
	* One such class was Neural Nets which was inspired by the structure of the human brain.
	* Computing limitations limited the applicability of Neural Nets.
* 2000s and 2010s
	* Explosion of computing power such as GPUs brought Neural Nets back to the spotlight.
	* All of a sudden very large Neural Nets were being trained and achieved spectacular results in NLP and Computer Vision.
	* These Neural Nets were much larger and complex as opposed to those in the 1980s and thus, gave rise to the term Deep Learning.

### 2.7 Tabular Data

* In machine learning, the most common type of data you'll encounter is tabular data—that is, data that is arranged in a data table. 
* This is essentially the same format as you work with when you look at data in a spreadsheet.
* All non-numerical data types (such as images, text, and categories) must eventually be represented as numbers.
* In machine learning, the numerical representation will be in the form of an array of numbers—that is, a vector.
* A vector is simply an array of numbers, such as `(1, 2, 3)`—or a nested array that contains other arrays of numbers, such as `(1, 2, (1, 2, 3))`.

#### Example of tabular data:

### 2.8 Scaling Data

* Scaling data means transforming it so that the values fit within some range or scale, such as `0–100` or `0–1`.
* Why scale?
	* Imagine you have an image represented as a set of RGB values ranging from `0 to 255`.
	* Imagine you have an image represented as a set of RGB values ranging from `0 to 255.
	* This scaling process will not affect the algorithm output since every value is scaled in the same way.
	* It can also speed up the training process, because now the algorithm only needs to handle numbers less than or equal to `1`.
* Approaches to scaling
	* Standardization
		* Rescales  data so that it has a mean of `0` and a standard deviation of `1`.
	* Normalization.
		*  Rescales the data into the range `[0, 1]`.

#### Standardization formula:

### 2.9 Encoding Categorical Data

* Machine learning algorithms need to have data in numerical form.
* When we have categorical data, we need to encode it in some way so that it is represented numerically. 
* Approaches: 
	* Ordinal encoding
		* we simply convert the categorical data into integer codes ranging from `0` to (number of categories `– 1`). 
		* One of the potential drawbacks to this approach is that it implicitly assumes an order across the categories.
	* One hot encoding
		* We transform each categorical value into a column. 
		* If there are `n` categorical values,`n` new columns are added.
		* One drawback of one-hot encoding is that it can potentially generate a very large number of columns.

#### Ordinal encoding example:

#### 2.10 Image Data

* Another example of a data type that is commonly used as input in machine learning problems—but that isn't initially in numerical format.
* How to represent an image as numbers?
	* The number of channels required to represent the color is known as the color depth or simply depth.
	* Grayscale images
		*  Each pixel can be represented by a single number, which typically ranges from 0 to 255.
		* This value determines how dark the pixel appears (e.g., `0` is black, while `255` is bright white).
		* In an RGB image, `depth = 3`, because there are three channels (Red, Green, and Blue).
	* Colored images
		*  Each pixel can be represented by a vector of three numbers (each ranging from 0 to 255) for the three primary color channels: red, green, and blue.
		* These three red, green, and blue (RGB) values are used together to decide the color of that pixel.
		* For example, purple might be represented as 1`28, 0, 128` (a mix of moderately intense red and blue, with no green).
		* A grayscale image has `depth = 1`, because there is only one channel.
* Three things are required to reproduce an image:
	* Horizontal position of each pixel.
	* Vertical position of each pixel.
	* Color of each pixel.
* The size of the vector required for any given image would be the `height * width * depth` of that image.
* Other preprocessing steps:
	* Uniform aspect ratio (e.g., by making sure all of the input images are square in shape).
	* Normalized (e.g. subtract mean pixel value in a channel from each pixel value in that channel).
	* Rotation
	* Cropping
	* Resizing
	* Denoising
	* Centering the image

### 2.11 Text Data

* One of the challenges that can come up in text analysis is that there are often multiple forms that mean the same thing.
	* The verb `to be` may show up as` is`, `am`, `are`, and so on.
	* A document may contain alternative spellings of a word, such as `behavior` vs. `behaviour`.
* Text normalization - process of transforming a piece of text into a canonical (official) form.
	* Lemmatization is an example of normalization.
	* A lemma is the dictionary form of a word and lemmatization is the process of reducing multiple inflections to that single dictionary form.
	*  Stop words are high-frequency words that are unnecessary (or unwanted) during the analysis. 
	* When you enter a query like `which cookbook has the best pancake recipe` into a search engine, the words `which` `and` `the` are far less relevant than `cookbook`,`pancake`, and `recipe`.
	* In this context, we might want to consider which and the to be stop words and remove them prior to analysis.
* Text vectorization - turning a piece of text into a vector.
	* After normalization we can take the next step of actually encoding it in a numerical form.
	* The goal here is to identify the particular features of the text that will be relevant to us for the 	particular task we want to perform.
	* Approaches:
		* Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization.
		* Word embedding, as done with Word2vec or Global Vectors (GloVe).
	* Brief example of TF-IDF:
		* The approach of TF-IDF is to give less importance to words that contain less information and are common in documents.
			* "the" and "this"
		* Give higher importance to words that contain relevant information and appear less frequently.
		* TF-IDF assigns weights to words that signify their relevance in the documents.
		* Each chunk of text gets a vector that is the length of the total number of words that we are interested in.
		* If the normalized text does not have the word in question, then the value in that position is `0`, whereas if it does have the word in question, it gets assigned to the importance of the word.
* Features Extraction
	* Vectors with length `n` can be visualized as a line in an `n` dimension space.
	* Any vector with the same length can be visualized in the same space.
	* How close one vector is to another can be calculated as vector distance.
	* If two vectors are close to each other, we can say the text represented by the two vectors have a similar meaning or have some connections.

### 2.12 Two Perspectives on ML

* Computer Science perspective:
	* We are using input features to create a program that can generate the desired output.
* Statistical perspective:
	* We are trying to find a mathematical function that, given the values of the independent variables can predict the values of the dependent variables.

#### Quizzes:

![Question 1](https://i.imgur.com/d3r7ftl.png)

### 2.13 The Computer Science Perspective

* For the rows in the table, we might call each row an entity or an observation about an entity.
* You'll also sometimes see a row of data referred to as an instance, in the sense that a row may be considered a single example (or instance) of data.
* For the columns in the table, we might refer to each column as a feature or attribute which describes the property of an entity.
* In a typical case of machine learning, you have some kind of input which you feed into the machine learning algorithm, and the algorithm produces some output.

Input example:

![Input example](https://i.imgur.com/wSmdopc.png)

#### Output example:

![Question 2](https://i.imgur.com/RePwQo2.png)		

### 2.14 The Statistical Perspective

* In statistics, you'll also see the data described in terms of independent variables and dependent variables.
* These names come from the idea that the value of one variable may depend on the value of some other variables.
	*  the selling `price` of a house is the dependent variable that depends on some independent variables—like the house's `location` and `size`.

#### Function examples:

![Function example 2](https://i.imgur.com/gCIcT4G.png)

### 2.15 The Tools for Machine Learning

* Libraries:
	* When you're working on a machine learning project, you likely will not want to write all of the necessary code yourself.
	* Instead, you'll want to make use of code that has already been created and refined. 
	*  A library is a collection of pre-written (and compiled) code that you can make use of in your own project. 
		* Numpy
		* Tensorflow
* Development environments:
	* A software application (or sometimes a group of applications) that provide a whole suite of tools designed to help you (as the developer or machine learning engineer) build out your projects.
		* Jupyter Notebooks
		* Visual Studio
* Cloud services
	* A service that offers data storage or computing power over the Internet.
	* In the context of machine learning, you can use a cloud service to access a server that is likely far more powerful than your own machine, or that comes equipped with machine learning models that are ready for you to use.

	* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a free, open-source software library for machine learning built by Google Brain.
	* [Keras](https://keras.io/) is a Python deep-learning library. It provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used to interface with other libraries, such as TensorFlow, in order to program neural networks. Keras is designed for rapid development and experimentation.
	* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source library for machine learning, developed in large part by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is known for being comparatively easy to use, especially for developers already familiar with Python and a Pythonic code style.
* Data Visualization
	* [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) is not itself a library, but rather a company that provides a number of different front-end tools for machine learning and data science—including an open source graphing library for Python.
	* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a Python library designed for plotting 2D visualizations. It can be used to produce graphs and other figures that are high quality and usable in professional publications. You'll see that the Matplotlib library is used by a number of other libraries and tools, such as SciKit Learn (above) and Seaborn (below). You can easily import Matplotlib for use in a Python script or to create visualizations within a Jupyter Notebook.
	* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python library designed specifically for data visualization. It is based on matplotlib, but provides a more high-level interface and has additional features for making visualizations more attractive and informative.
	* [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) is an interactive data visualization library. In contrast to a library like matplotlib that generates a static image as its output, Bokeh generates visualizations in HTML and JavaScript. This allows for web-based visualizations that can have interactive features.

### 2.25 Learning a function 

* We can generally think of a machine learning algorithm as a process for learning, and models as specific representations that we train using data.
* Machine learning algorithms aim to learn a target function `(f)` that describes the mapping between data input variables `(X)` and an output variable `(Y)`.
* The core goal is to learn a useful transformation of the input data that gets us closer to the expected output.
* Since the process extrapolates from a limited set of values, there will always be an error `e`.
* The variable`e` is called **irreducible error** because no matter how good we get at estimating the target function (ff), we cannot reduce this error.
* Note that the irreducible error we're discussing here is different from the model error we talked about earlier in the lesson.
* Irreducible error is caused by the data collection process—such as when we don't have enough data or don't have enough data features.
* In contrast, the model error measures how much the prediction made by the model is different from the true output.
* The model error is generated from the model and can be reduced during the model learning process.

### 2.26 Parametric vs. Non-parametric

* Based on the assumptions about the shape and structure of the function they try to learn, machine learning algorithms can be divided into two categories: 
	* **Parametric Machine Learning Algorithms**
		* Parametric machine learning algorithms make assumptions about the mapping function and have a fixed number of parameters. 
		* No matter how much data is used to learn the model, this will not change how many parameters the algorithm has.
		* With a parametric algorithm, we are selecting the form of the function and then learning its coefficients using the training data.
		* Example:
			* Linear Regression
		*  Benefits:
			* Simpler and easier to understand; easier to interpret the results
			* Faster when talking about learning from data
			* Less training data required to learn the mapping function, working well even if the fit to data is not perfect	
	* **Nonparametric Machine Learning Algorithms**
		* Non-parametric algorithms do not make assumptions regarding the form of the mapping function between input data and output.
		* Consequently, they are free to learn any functional form from the training data.
		* Example:
			* K-Nearest Neighbors
		* Benefits:
			* High flexibility, in the sense that they are capable of fitting a large number of functional forms.
			* Power by making weak or no assumptions on the underlying function
			* High performance in the prediction models that are produced
		* Limitations:
			* More training data is required to estimate the mapping function
			* Slower to train, generally having far more parameters to train
			* Overfitting the training data is a risk; overfitting makes it harder to explain the resulting predictions.

### 2.27 Classical ML vs. Deep Learning
 
* All deep learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms but not all machine learning algorithms are deep learning algorithms.
* Deep learning algorithms are based on neural networks and the classical ML algorithms are based on classical mathematical algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, and so on.
* **Deep learning advantages**:
	* Suitable for high complexity problems.
	* Better accuracy, compared to classical ML.
	* Better support for big data.
	* Complex features can be learned .
* **Deep learning disadvantages**:
	* Difficult to explain trained data.
	* Require significant computational power.
* **Classical ML advantages**:
	* More suitable for small data.
	* Easier to interpret outcomes.
	* Cheaper to perform.
	* Can run on low-end machines.
	* Does not require large computational power.
* **Classical ML disadvantages**:
	* Difficult to learn large datasets.
	* Require feature engineering.
	* Difficult to learn complex functions.

### 2.28 Approaches to Machine Learning

* There are three main approaches to machine learning:
	* **Supervised learning** - Learns from data that contains both the inputs and expected outputs
		*  **Classification**: Outputs are categorical.
		* **Regression**: Outputs are continuous and numerical.
		* **Similarity learning**: Learns from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar two objects are.
		* **Feature learning**: Learns to automatically discover the representations or features from raw data.
		* **Anomaly detection**: A special form of classification, which learns from data labeled as normal/abnormal.
	* **Unsupervised learning** - Learns from input data only; finds hidden structure in input data.
		* **Clustering**: Assigns entities to clusters or groups.
		* **Feature learning**: Features are learned from unlabeled data.
		* **Anomaly detection**: Learns from unlabeled data, using the assumption that the majority of entities are normal. 
	* **Reinforcement learning** - Learns how an agent should take action in an environment in order to maximize a reward function.
		* **Markov decision process**: A mathematical process to model decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. Does not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model.
* The main difference between reinforcement learning and other machine learning approaches is that reinforcement learning is an active process where the actions of the agent influence the data observed in the future, hence influencing its own potential future states.
* In contrast, supervised and unsupervised learning approaches are passive processes where learning is performed without any actions that could influence the data.

### 2.29 The Trade-Offs

* **Bias vs. Variance**
	* **Bias**: 
		* Bias measures how inaccurate the model prediction is in comparison with the true output. 
		* It is due to erroneous assumptions made in the machine learning process to simplify the model and make the target function easier to learn. 
		* High model complexity tends to have a low bias. 
	* **Variance**:
		* Variance measures how much the target function will change if different training data is used. 
		* Variance can be caused by modeling the random noise in the training data. 
		* High model complexity tends to have a high variance.
	* As a general trend, parametric and linear algorithms often have high bias and low variance, whereas non-parametric and non-linear algorithms often have low bias and high variance.
* **Overfitting vs. Underfitting**
	* **Overfitting**:
		* Overfitting refers to the situation in which models fit the training data very well, but fail to generalize to new data.
	* **Underfitting**:
		* Underfitting refers to the situation in which models neither fit the training data nor generalize to new data.
* **Bias vs. Variance Trade-off** 
	* The **prediction error** can be viewed as the sum of model error (error coming from the model) and the irreducible error (coming from data collection).
	* **Low bias**:
		* Low bias means fewer assumptions about the target function.
		* Having fewer assumptions can help generalize relevant relations between features and target outputs.
		* Example:
			* KNN
			* Decision Trees 
	* **High bias**:
		* high bias means more assumptions about the target function.
		* Having more assumptions can potentially miss important relations between features and outputs and cause underfitting.
		* Example:
			* Linear Regression  
	* **Low variance**:
		*  Low variance indicates changes in training data would result in similar target functions. 
		* Example:
			* Linear Regression
	* **High variance**:
		*  High variance indicates changes in training data would result in very different target functions. 
		* High variance suggests that the algorithm learns the random noise instead of the output and causes overfitting.
		* Example:
			* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
	* The goal of training machine learning models is to achieve low bias and low variance. The **optimal model complexity** is where bias error crosses with variance error.
* **Dealing with Overfitting vs. Underfitting**:
	*  [k-fold cross-validation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/): 
		* It splits the initial training data into k subsets and train the model k times. In each training, it uses one subset as the testing data and the rest as training data.
	* **Validation dataset**: 
		* hold back a validation dataset from the initial training data to estimatete how well the model generalizes on new data.
	* **Simplify the model**: 
		* For example, using fewer layers or less neurons to make the neural network smaller.
use more data.
	* **Reduce dimensionality** :
		* Reduce dimensionality in training data such as PCA: it projects training data into a smaller dimension to decrease the model complexity.
	* **Early stopping**: 
		* Stop the training early when the performance on the testing dataset has not improved after a number of training iterations.
